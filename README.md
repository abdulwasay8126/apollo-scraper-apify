## 🔧 Configuration Tips

### For Maximum Speed
- Set `enrichProfiles: false`

- Use `minDelay: 2` and `maxDelay: 4`

### For Maximum Data
- Set `enrichProfiles: true`
- Increase `maxPages` to 50-100
- Keep default delays (3-7 seconds)

### For Best Reliability
- Enable `useApifyProxy: true`
- Use longer delays (5-10 seconds)
- Process URLs one at a time

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free Account Limits
- Free Apollo accounts have monthly search limits (~50-100 searches)
- Some emails may be locked/hidden on free tier
- The scraper respects these limits and scrapes what's visible

### Session Persistence
- After first login, cookies are saved
- Future runs use saved session (faster!)
- No need to login every time

### Proxy Recommendation
- **Strongly recommended** to use Apify proxies
- Prevents IP bans and rate limiting
- Already included in input template

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Login failed"
- Double-check your Apollo credentials
- Make sure account is active
- Try logging in manually first

### "No results found"
- Verify the URL is correct
- Check if your free searches are exhausted
- Make sure you're using search/profile URLs

### Actor Runs Slow
- This is intentional! Delays prevent detection
- Disable enrichment for faster runs
- Reduce maxPages

### "Session expired"
- The actor will re-login automatically
- Saved cookies refresh on each run

---

## 📈 Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test with 1-2 pages first
2. **Use Proxies**: Enable Apify proxy for reliability
3. **Respect Limits**: Don't scrape aggressively
4. **Monitor Usage**: Check Apollo's free search limits
5. **Enrich Selectively**: Only enrich when you need detailed data
