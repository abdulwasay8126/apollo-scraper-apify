# ðŸ“¦ Original Chrome Extension Files

This folder contains the original Chrome extension files that were converted into the Apify actor.

## Files

- **manifest.json** - Chrome extension manifest
- **popup.html** - Extension popup UI
- **popup.js** - Extension scraping logic
- **clip.png** - Extension icon

## About

These files are the original Apollo.io data scraper Chrome extension created by [Liveupx](https://www.youtube.com/@liveupx).

The extension required:
- Manual installation in Chrome
- Being on the Apollo.io page
- Clicking buttons to scrape
- Manual CSV download

## What Changed?

This project converted the extension into a cloud-based Apify actor that:
- âœ… Runs in the cloud (no browser needed)
- âœ… Fully automated (no manual clicks)
- âœ… Schedulable runs
- âœ… API access
- âœ… Works on any device
- âœ… Free tier available

## Using the Original Extension

If you still want to use the Chrome extension:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select this `chrome-extension-original` folder
5. Click the extension icon when on Apollo.io

## Migrating to Apify Actor

We recommend using the Apify actor instead because:
- No installation required
- Works from anywhere
- Fully automated
- Better reliability
- Cloud storage
- API access

See the main [README.md](../README.md) for the Apify actor documentation.
