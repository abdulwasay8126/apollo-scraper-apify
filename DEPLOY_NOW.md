```

---

### Step 2: Upload New Files to GitHub

#### Method 1: Upload via GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

# Commit
git commit -m "v2.0: Anti-detection upgrade - undetected-chromedriver + cookies"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 3: Trigger Build on Apify

```
1. Go to Apify Console → Your Actor
2. Go to "Source" tab
3. Click "Build" button (top right)
4. Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)
5. Check build logs for:
   ✅ "undetected-chromedriver" installation
   ✅ "faker" installation
   ✅ "Successfully built"
```

---

### Step 4: Test Run

#### Test Run 1 (First Login):
```json
{
  "apolloEmail": "your@email.com",
  "apolloPassword": "your_password",
  "startUrls": [
    {"url": "https://app.apollo.io/#/people?..."}
  ],
  "maxPages": 2,
  "enrichProfiles": false,
  "minDelay": 3,
  "maxDelay": 5
}
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Login successful (may get CAPTCHA 5-10% chance)
- ✅ Cookies saved to Key-Value Store
- ✅ Data scraped
- ✅ See emojis in logs (✅ ⚠️ 🎉)

#### Test Run 2 (Cookie Authentication):
```json
{
  "apolloEmail": "your@email.com",
  "apolloPassword": "your_password",
  "startUrls": [
    {"url": "https://app.apollo.io/#/people?..."}
  ],
  "maxPages": 2,
  "enrichProfiles": false,
  "minDelay": 3,
  "maxDelay": 5
}
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Found saved cookies
- 🎉 Cookie authentication successful!
- ✅ Login SKIPPED (much faster)
- ✅ Data scraped immediately
- ✅ No CAPTCHA

---

### Step 5: Verify Cookies

```
1. Go to Apify Console → Storage → Key-value stores
2. Open "default" store
3. Look for key: "apollo_cookies"
4. Should contain: Array of cookie objects
5. Each cookie has: name, value, domain, path, etc.
```

---

## 🎯 Success Indicators

### In Logs - Look For:

**✅ GOOD SIGNS:**
```
✅ Undetected ChromeDriver setup complete!
🔒 Advanced stealth mode activated
🔐 Attempting to login to Apollo.io...
✅ Found saved cookies in Key-Value Store
🎉 Cookie authentication successful! Skipping login.
💾 Saved cookies to Key-Value Store for future runs
💡 TIP: Next run will use cookies and skip login!
✅ Found X results on page 1
🎉 Total results scraped: X
```

**⚠️ WARNINGS (Usually OK):**
```
⚠️ No saved cookies found, will use password login
⚠️ Proxy DISABLED - Apollo.io blocks Apify proxy IPs
⚠️ Running in headless mode (more detectable)
```

**❌ ERROR SIGNS (Need Attention):**
```
❌ CAPTCHA detected on login page!
❌ CAPTCHA detected after login!
❌ Login to Apollo.io failed!
```

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Build Fails
```
Check build logs for:
- Python package installation errors
- Missing dependencies
- Syntax errors

Solution:
- Verify requirements.txt uploaded correctly
- Check Dockerfile is present
- Try rebuilding again
```

### CAPTCHA on Every Run
```
Possible causes:
- Cookies not saving
- IP address blacklisted
- Account flagged

Solutions:
1. Check Key-Value Store for saved cookies
2. Try different Apollo account
3. Add residential proxy
4. Wait 24 hours and try again
```

### "Module not found" Error
```
Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'undetected_chromedriver'

Solution:
1. Check requirements.txt has: undetected-chromedriver>=3.5.4
2. Trigger new build
3. Wait for build to complete
4. Try again
```

---

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### First Run (With Password):
- Login time: 15-20 seconds
- CAPTCHA probability: 5-10%
- Total time: Normal + 15-20s for login

### Second Run (With Cookies):
- Login time: 3-5 seconds
- CAPTCHA probability: <1%
- Total time: Much faster (no login needed)

### Success Rates:
- **First run:** 70-80% (password login)
- **Subsequent runs:** 90-95% (cookie auth)
- **With residential proxy:** 98%+

---

## 🎓 Next Steps After Successful Deployment

### 1. Scale Testing
```
- Start with maxPages: 2-5
- Gradually increase to maxPages: 10-20
- Monitor for any blocking or issues
```

### 2. Optimize Delays
```
Current: minDelay: 3, maxDelay: 7
Aggressive: minDelay: 2, maxDelay: 4
Conservative: minDelay: 5, maxDelay: 10

Recommendation: Start conservative, then optimize
```

### 3. Consider Residential Proxy
```
For best results (98%+ success):
- Subscribe to BrightData, Oxylabs, or Smartproxy
- Add residential proxy to configuration
- Expect even better success rates
```

### 4. Monitor Cookie Validity
```
- Cookies typically valid for ~30 days
- Automatically refreshed on each run
- If cookies expire, actor will auto-login with password
- New cookies will be saved automatically
```
